# Unsecure Program

## Overview

This program is written in Rust using the Anchor framework.

( This is for my Program security test  ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—)

## Identified Vulnerabilities 

### 1. **Lack of Access Control**
   - The `remove_user` function does not check if the caller is the owner of the user account. This could allow any user to close any account, leading to potential abuse.
   
### 2. **No Validation on User Input**
   - The `initialize` function does not validate the length or content of the `name` string, which could lead to unexpected behavior or storage issues, such as truncation or overflows.
   
### 3. **Potential for Integer Underflow**
   - In the `transfer_points` function, if `amount` exceeds the `sender.points`, the code returns an error, but further logic added in the future could inadvertently cause an underflow.

### 4. **No Event Emission for Critical Actions**
   - While messages are logged using `msg!`, critical actions such as user creation, point transfers, or account removal should emit events for better transparency and auditing.

### 5. **Insufficient Error Handling**
   - The `remove_user` function does not handle cases where the user account does not exist, which could result in unexpected behavior.

### 6. **Hardcoded Initial Points**
   - The initial points for a user are hardcoded to 1000. If business logic changes, this could become a bottleneck for scalability and customization. This should be dynamic. ( Yes yes, i know my Mentor Bolt did it Intentionally ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ )

### 7. **Potential for Reentrancy Attacks**
   - Although no external calls are present in the current code, reentrancy attacks could become an issue if external calls are introduced in the future.

### 8. **Seed Collision**
   - The use of `id.to_le_bytes()` as part of the account seed could lead to collisions if the same ID is used across different programs or contexts. Consider a more robust ID scheme.

### 9. **Lack of Rate Limiting**
   - There is no rate limiting in place. If this program is exposed to external calls, users could abuse it by flooding the system with requests. ( Should i say it would be like a DOS Attack ? Yes let me put it that way hahaha ðŸ˜„ )

### 10. **No Ownership Transfer Logic**
   - The code lacks a mechanism for transferring ownership of user accounts. This could be necessary for future features like account recovery or user delegation. ( Still trying to improve my Rust game tho ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž. )

## Program Structure

### Functions

1. **`initialize`**
   - Initializes a new user account with an ID, name, and 1000 points.
   - No validation on the name input.
   
   **Potential Improvements**:
   - Add name validation (length and characters).
   - Make initial points configurable.
   
   ```rust
   pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<CreateUser>, id: u32, name: String) -> Result<()> {
       let user = &mut ctx.accounts.user;
       user.id = id;
       user.owner = *ctx.accounts.signer.key;
       user.name = name;
       user.points = 1000;
       msg!("Created new user with 1000 points and id: {}", id);
       Ok(())
   }
